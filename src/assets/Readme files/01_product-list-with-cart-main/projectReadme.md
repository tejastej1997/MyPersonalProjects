### The challenge

- 1.Your challenge is to build out this product list project that includes a functional cart and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

- 2.You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So, if you have something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.


- 3.We provide the data for the products in a local `data.json` file. So you can use that to populate the UI dynamically if you choose.


## Your users should be able to: 

- 1.Add items to the cart and remove them
- 2.Increase/decrease the number of items in the cart
- 3.See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order"
- 4.Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order"
- 5.View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- 6.See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
